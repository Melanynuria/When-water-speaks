# ðŸ’§ When Water Speaks: Discovering Invisible Patterns to Improve the Hydric Future

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
**When Water Speaks** is a data-driven project developed as part of the **AigÃ¼es de Barcelona Data Challenge** and the **Pompeu Fabra University Project Management Course (GP2526)**.  
The goal of this project is to analyze water consumption data to **detect and predict anomalies**, identify **hidden consumption patterns**, and promote **responsible water management** in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area.

The project combines **data science**, **machine learning**, and **social awareness** to develop an intelligent system capable of:
- Detecting irregular consumption or potential leaks.
- Predicting future anomalies based on seasonal patterns (e.g., higher summer usage, hot water consumption in winter).
- Generating **personalized alerts** for users.
- Supporting an **awareness campaign** to encourage sustainable water use.

## ðŸ§  Objectives
- Apply advanced data analytics and AI techniques to analyze water consumption data.
- Detect and predict anomalies to improve water management efficiency.
- Develop a prototype alert system for users.
- Promote awareness about sustainable and responsible water consumption.
